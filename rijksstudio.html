								<p>We departed from the idea that, no matter how good and intuitive a design may seem to its designer, it can still be challenging for the people it was designed for. Only when we observe them interacting with the product can we understand what usability problems there are and what causes these problems. To achieve this understanding, a series of user trials were conducted, whereby we observed users' actual behaviour while performing a series of tasks, as opposed to reported behaviours that they could report on interviews.</p>

							<h3 class="card-title">Results and Conclusions</h3>
							<div class="content-text">
								<p>Based on the aggregated answers from all of our participants we can easily conclude what are the most problematic tasks that our users had the most difficult time trying to complete as well as the easiest ones.</p>
								<p>The most difficult tasks that none of the users were able to complete in time or at all were trying to find details on the Rijksstudio, creating a route and downloading an image. Considering that all three of these features add most of the value to the Rijksstudio, improving them would be crucial for an overall better user experience. The easiest tasks were to access the Rijksstudio and find information about a specific painting and they were completed by all participants.</p>
								<p>When it comes to the expectations of our participants, the difficulty level was considerably lower before any of them started a task compared to what it actually ended up being. As they performed more tasks and they encountered more problems, their expectations for following tasks considerably changed expecting them to be more difficult.</p>
								<p>As an overall trend of the majority of the tasks, the reality did not meet the expectations of our participants and most of them ended up being confused and overwhelmed. Most of the tasks resulted in a higher difficulty level from Medium - High and Impossible when participants just gave up on trying to complete the tasks.</p>
